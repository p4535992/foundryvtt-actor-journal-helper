  "description": "Actor Journal Helper is a module that builds on the DnD5e - Fifth Edition System within Foundry VTT to provide users with a simple way to generate individual journal pages for each actor. It simplifies the process of creating journal pages by adding a link to the biography tab of the actor's character sheet. This link not only generates and/or pulls up the associated journal page but also creates a link on the journal page back to the actor. This feature is accessible to users with at least limited ownership of the actor.",
